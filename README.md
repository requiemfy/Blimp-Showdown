## For contributors 🔨

Thank you for your interest in contributing to Blimp. I am looking to record every `contributor's name` on the game's official website (if you like your name to be there). 

### Step by step guide 🪜

Follow this step-by-step guide for best practices and avoid wasting your effort.

#### STEP 0: Propose your change on [Discussions](https://github.com/TungVietLe/Blimp-Showdown/discussions) *(optional)* 
* A good way to see beforehand how the community would react to your suggested change.

#### STEP 1: Pick an Issue [here](https://github.com/TungVietLe/Blimp-Showdown/issues)

* Your screen would look something like this. For you to avoid wasting time and energy on something that is eventually unused, **Pick the issue that has the `approved` label**.

* If there is no issue you want to work on, click on `New issue` button to create a new issue and write your suggested changes there. **Then, wait until the issue is `approved`**. Once it's approved, you may start working on it.

#### STEP 2: Once you pick the issue you want to work on, wait to get assigned to it

* Again, to avoid wasting time and energy on something that is eventually unused, check until you get assigned to the issue before working on it.
* *Tips: even if the issue is assigned to someone else, you can still ask them to reassign it to you if they are no longer working on it.*

#### STEP 3: Start contributing!
* `Fork` this repo then work on it.
* Once you get `assigned` on an `approved` issue. Feel free to work on it and show off your skills! We all appreciate your contribution.

#### STEP 4: Merge your work for the world to see

* Once you ready, `create a pull request` with the title mentioning which `issue #` you are solving. For example: `#5 docs: contributor guide init`

That's it! Thanks for your contribution. Now relax and sit back until your work is live on the game!
